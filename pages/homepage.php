                            I'm Tran Dai Phat, a final-year student at Saigon University, majoring in Information Technology. I have a strong passion for websites, databases, and operating systems. I always seek opportunities to challenge myself and grow in this field.
                            During my university years, I have had the chance to work on various interesting and diverse projects. Through these experiences, I have developed problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and the ability to find effective solutions.
                            I have identified some strengths in myself, such as being dedicated to my work, being eager to learn new knowledge, and being able to handle work pressures.
                            I also have areas that need improvement, such as lack of confidence in a new environment. However, I have recognized this and I am making efforts to improve in this regard.</div>
